### Hello there!

I am a frontend web developer, currently mainly working with Vue.js.

I have an education background of Physics (BSc.) and Information Systems (MSc.), and also specialized hands-on training toward full stack development.

- ðŸš€ In March 2021, I have completed a 9-week, intensive, full stack web development bootcamp at Ironhack.
- ðŸŒ± Since April 2021, I've been working as a frontend developer, and developing the frontend part of big scale full stack projects using Vue.js.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on frontend (React or Vue) or full stack (MERN or MEVN) projects.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love singing, making music with my guitar, and creating music and sound effects for video games ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¤˜ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽµ
